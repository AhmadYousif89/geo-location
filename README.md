# Geo Location

- Get information about countries using geo-location API

### Usage

- You can search by any country name.
- You can search by country coordinates [ lat - long ].
- Or simply get your geo location with a click of a button.

### FAQ

- If you don't know the coordinates you can first search by name then get the coords from the fetched country information.

- Some countries have their coords shortend , e.g [ lat: 12.1 ] | [ lng: -77.0 ] , if you try to search coords with these info you might get ERROR [ Found NO Country! ] , in this case you can simply add some digits to the coords , e.g [ lat: 12.1461 ] | [ lng: -77.0546 ] and it should work fine.

- Geocode API is NOT 100% accurate , some coords will point to the wrong country sometimes and sometimes will not return any country ☹
